## 第一讲：货币的三种基本功能

1. Precious metal 贵重金属
2. Sweating the money 从货币里提取贵重金属成分
3. Holey dollar 有洞的钱币，这是十九世纪在澳大利亚新南威尔士州流通的货币，因为缺乏金属材料而将钱币穿洞
4. Token 辅币，具有象征性的货币，代表的价值高于本身的价值
5. Plastic note 塑料钞票
6. Plastic card （塑料）信用卡，也叫 credit card
7. Moneys got a very colourful history, because a number of things have been used in the place of what we use as money. Feathers（羽毛）, shells, cloth ...salt in Roman times when the Roman soldiers were paid in salt and thats how we get the word salary, from the Latin sal for salt. 古罗马士兵得到的军饷就是盐，英文中工资Salary就是从它演变而来的。
8. And in those days, Spanish coins were used a lot. Sometimes stores used certain tokens because there was a shortage of actual coinage（硬币）. And then there is money as we know it today in notes and coins - plastic notes.
9. 哈珀教授授说，货币的三个功能[1]是：
  - 1. Medium of exchange 交换媒介：commodity（商品） which facilitates（加速） the exchange of goods and services.
  - 2. Unit of account 计算单位：reckon（估算） prices and reckon values for comparisons between goods and services or over time.
  - 3. Store of value 价值储存手段：not consume today, we can hold money instead - and transfer that consumption power（消费力） to some point in the future.

## 第二讲：货币还必须具备三种特性

- portability 可携带性
- durability 持久性
- divisibility 可分性[2]

1. In the earliest days, for example in ancient Babylon（巴比伦）, measures of wheat（小麦） were the money commodity.（商品货币，实物货币）
2. People would exchange other goods and services firstly by exchanging quantities of wheat.
3. And eventually it was worked out by the Babylonian priests that they could hold the wheat in a central store and then simply keep records of who owned the wheat.
4. And rather than physically moving the wheat around, eventually we had a primitive system（原始簿记制度） - quite advanced by the terms of the day - of record keeping.
5. So even though the problem of portability（可便携性） was solved, a further one was still present, that of durability（持久性）. Because wheat perishes over time, its not a good store of value.
6. What are good stores of value, of course, are precious metals such as gold and silver. Its not difficult to see why these became a form of money, but in their earliest forms, they were not easily divisible.
7. You didnt always have the precise amount, or you couldnt get change. So divisibility is a key property of money.
8. We had ledgers.（分户账）

## 第三讲：名义货币

A credit instrument is an obligation. And its used as money because it has value.
And the value that it has, of course, is a value which is based upon its credit-worthiness, in other words, how much credit or how much credence people give to the promise which is actually written down.
What Im receiving or using as an instrument for money purposes is somebody elses obligation.
Their preparedness to do something for me which might be to give me fiat money.
That could be the promise which is incorporated in the cheque or the bill of exchange.

1 fiat money 名义货币，法定货币
2 credit money 信用货币
3 credit instrument 信用手段，信用安排
4 credit - worthiness 信贷价值，信用声誉

## 第二十四讲：亚洲金融危机

1. In all these countries, the trouble started in the financial sector（金融行业）. The question is, how did it move from the financial sector to the real economy, to economic growth, to real GDP（Gross Domestic Product 的缩写）国内生产总值?
2. Well there are several channels. Number one is what we call in economics a negative wealth effect. If the stockmarket declines by 40%, then people feel less wealthy; if they feel less wealthy they buy less; if they buy less, less is produced and fewer people are employed. So thats one channel.

But there were other channels through investments where the credit system was flawed; even sound companies couldnt get credit with which to produce, with which to buy material, with which to buy capital, with which to invest and to produce. So the credit system problem ... that lubricant of the economy was non-existent. So those are only some of the channels through which it moved from the financial sector to the real economy.
Theres an intrinsic flaw in the system. Theres no constraint at all on short-term lending, international lending, but theres no international lender of the last resort facility which can assure this debt can be redeemed.

Of course its being spent on projects which have a life longer than the term of the debt. I mean, thats a rather complicated way of saying that theres a mismatch between the term of the lending and the investment period for which its being used, as there is in the case of domestic banks - if you have a cheque account at a bank, the bank is in fact using that to lend money on projects which might have a life of two or three, or longer years, but you can withdraw the money tomorrow. And the way in which this is reconciled for a bank is ultimately, say the Reserve Bank of Australia can provide liquidity, has a lender of the last resort role.

But theres no such role internationally, and that means that lenders have an incentive to stampede, to have a run on a country. And at the moment we dont have a way of dealing with that.
